I am not the author of this code, so these comments have a disclaimer.
An interesting bug with the code as it is was brought to light by
Alan Aronoff who used the existing Makefile to compile the code.  For
both HP-UX and SGI he found errors on the 27th line of mffta4.  The
code was compiled with the -C option.  It seems that this error is
not at all relevant, so I have removed this option from the Makefile.
