= Documentation generation process

The 'trustpy' tools generates a Python module from the XD comments put in the C++ code.
This Python module can be used to manipulate TRUST datasets, or to generate documentation.

The final documentation is hosted at :
    https://github.com/cea-trust-platform/trust-documentation

The on-line documentation is generated by the 'readthedocs' engine, which configuration is found at the root of documentation the repo:
    ./.readthedocs.yaml
    
This configuration file 
- loads a Conda environment on the remote server, and then
- triggers the Sphinx build whose configuration is located in
    doc/conf.py
    
In turn this conf.py triggers:
    - the build of the Doxygen C++ documentation (see end of the conf.py file)
    - the usual build of the Sphinx documentation from the rst files located in 
        doc/source/srcs
        
The sub-folder doc/source/srcs is divided in 4 parts
    - doxy: for all doxygen related build (there is notably a copy of the TRUST C++ sources in this directory)
    - generic: for the TRUST Generic guide
    - reference: for the TRUST keyword reference manual (see below)
    - trustutils: for all the Jupyter and truststats Python API documentation 
    
The TRUST keyword reference manual is generated from a file named all.rst. To re-rebuild this file, one can go to the root TRUST directory, into
    Outils/trustpy
source
    env.sh
    cd src
    python gen_doc.py ../install/generated/trustpy_gen.py ../install/generated
    
This will build a file called 'all.rst' into ../install/generated, and this file can be updated into the documentation repository.
