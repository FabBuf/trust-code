This test is really about ICoCo:
    - we use the Pilote_ICoCo keyword which is emulating inside TRUST a typical ICoCo supervisor time loop
    - and we test various Champ_Input

'ICoCo_ChDonXYZ.data' is the root dataset so that the usual TRUST testing logic works, but the real
stuff happens in the other dataset.
